This is my final year project which is related to credit scoring.
We used ensemble learning classifiers like Random Forest Classifier Gradient Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Bagging. The least accuracy
we got from decision trees was up to 85%. The most accurate of these classifiers were
gradient boosting and bagging, with an accuracy of up to 90%. The final model has been
developed and deployed using Flask (micro-framework for backend web development in
Python).
